I am teaching web development in my Sigma web development course. Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders","number":"18","start":962.36,"end":964.36,"text":" How the box model works."},{"title":"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders","number":"18","start":315.52,"end":317.16,"text":" Now what does the box model say?"},{"title":"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders","number":"18","start":109.92,"end":112.76,"text":" What is the concept of box model in CSS?"},{"title":"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders","number":"18","start":0.0,"end":4.2,"text":" Guys, in today's video we are going to talk about box model in CSS."},{"title":"CSS Box Model - Margin, Padding & Borders","number":"18","start":102.64,"end":107.16,"text":" I will put styles here and tell you how the box model works in CSS."}]

"where is box model taught"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way (dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video (in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
